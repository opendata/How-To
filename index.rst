How to Open Data
================

*A practical guide to opening data, for government employees whose job it is to make that happen.*

Maybe you're excited to open your data, maybe you're just checking off a box, maybe somebody is making you do this. But it's a thing that has to happen. This is for you.

This is a book in the process of being written, in some areas skeletal in its contents. See `the GitHub repository <https://github.com/opendata/How-To/issues>`_ to see what needs to be done and to lend a hand.
