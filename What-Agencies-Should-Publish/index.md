# What Agencies Should Publish

The most important data for agencies to publish is the data that they know to be valuable. The data that they're asked for often, the data that they rely on, the data that their experience tells them is a crucial output of their agency. But, for various reasons, that's not always enough to go on. So here, broken down by agency, is a list of the datasets that tend to be valuable to publish.

Note that [there are core datasets that state and local governments should prioritize publishing](Core-Datasets.md)—these are the datasets that make it possible to connect other datasets together, to navigate the collective data structure of government.
