## Data

### Official opinions

Many attorneys general publish official legal opinions on behalf of the state, in response to queries from officials or citizens, in order to establish or clarify the state’s position on a legal matter. These are formatted prose, so the opinions themselves do not lend themselves to being rendered as data (they’re often PDFs), but there is substantial metadata around each opinion that can be rendered as data.

For each opinion, incude the date of publication, the opinion’s unique identifier (if there is one), the name of the requestor (if there is one), the author, the summary (if one exists), the section identifier for the law in question, and a URL for the text of the opinion.
